UOS_LINGUISTIC_PROMPT = """You split hotel review sentences into Unit Aspect Sentences (UAS).

A UAS contains exactly ONE aspect term and ONE sentiment orientation toward that aspect.

Return a JSON array containing ONLY ONE unit.
This unit must mention or reference the aspect term provided in [aspect: ...].
No explanation.
No extra text.

## GOAL

Extract a minimal aspect-focused sentence suitable for Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA).

The input sentence contains $T$ as a placeholder for the aspect term.
The actual aspect term is provided in [aspect: ...].

Return ONLY ONE sentence that:
- Mentions the aspect term (replace $T$ with the aspect name)
- Captures the sentiment toward that aspect
- Is complete and readable

Rewrite fragments into complete standalone sentences when necessary:

* add articles ("The", "A")
* add a copula ("is", "was", "are", "were")
* replace $T$ with the actual aspect term
* preserve the original wording

Never invent aspects, sentiments, attributes, or details.
